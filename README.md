# CJP Rhyme Data

This repository provides manually annotated rhyme data from the Cang Jie pian, as well as Python code with which the data can be processed, checked for consistency, and standardized. 

More information on the background of the data can be found at https://calc.hypotheses.org/2525. The data themselves can be found in the form of an Excel spreadsheet in the folder `raw`.

While the raw data has already been prepared, the code will be prepared soon and discussed in an additional blogpost.
